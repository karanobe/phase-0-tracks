1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML5 semantic tags are used to differentiate different sections on the page. They especially come in
useful if people with disabilities are trying to read the webpage. For example, the HTML5 semantic tag "aside"
could inform the reader that they are reading an aside section that doesn't necessarily correlate directly with
the main content of the page. This helps them decide whether or not they want to read that portion. In addition, 
semantic tags can be assigned different formatting using CSS depending on the section. The most useful semantic 
tag would be <main> because it is generally the portion of the page that most people came to read.

2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
A browser generally reads a page from top to bottom, and will subsequentially load it starting from the top, and working
its way down. Thus, its generally a good idea to have your head, and title appear first on the page, followed by body, footer, aside, and nav.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that Sublime helps you save a lot of time by easily letting you develop snippets, or templates. I'll definitely be
using snippets later on to create more complex web pages.

4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
Prior to this challenge, tables were difficult for me. However, this challenge helped me build a table from scratch and developed my
understanding of them. Moreover, the different semantic tags used in this challenge further developed my understanding of the structure
of a webpage, and the application of CSS(in the future), in order to differentiate the different sections of the page.
