# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
'Version control allows us to review the entire history of revisions to 
one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It is a 
popular way to protect software, because if someone make a mistake in their
version, we can easily revert back to a previous version, or have a log that 
can help us find the mistake.'
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
'A branch in Git gives you a "copy" of your project to work on. You would use
a branch if multiple people were working on the same code, but possibly adding
additional features. They could potentially be working on a different branch
of the same code, simultaneously, without breaking the entire code.'
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
'A commit is essentially a save point for the project. A good commit message
is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.'
* What is a merge conflict?
'In Git, if the same file is being changed by multiple users, if
one person is updating the line, while another person is deleting the line,
Git simply cannt know what is correct. That is an example of a merge conflict.
In this case, you have to solve this conflict and designate the correct change
and Git will implement it.'
